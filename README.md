## Features

### Control System Design
- **LQR (Linear Quadratic Regulator)**  
  Optimal state-feedback control for continuous and discrete-time systems.
  
- **Servo and Regulator Design**  
  Regulator for disturbance rejection and servo control for setpoint tracking.

- **Observer Design**  
  State estimation using Luenberger observers and Kalman filters for both discrete and continuous systems.

### Guidance Algorithms
- **CLOS (Command to Line of Sight)**  
  Simple and effective guidance law for missile and robot navigation.

- **Proportional Navigation & Pursuit Guidance**  
  Classical intercept guidance algorithms for target following.

- **Lambert Guidance**  
  Two-point boundary value solution for orbital rendezvous and long-range interception.

- **Target and Trajectory Following**  
  Closed-loop controllers for dynamic target tracking and waypoint-based trajectory following.

### Sliding Mode Control for Quadrotor
- **Robust Nonlinear Control**  
  Implementation of sliding mode control (SMC) for quadrotor stabilization and trajectory tracking, offering robustness against modeling uncertainties and disturbances.
